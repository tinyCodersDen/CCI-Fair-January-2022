# CCI-Fair-January-2022
My repo for the January 2022 CCI Fair. 

Run main.py for the website and if you want to download the a-z handwritten data, visit [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/sachinpatel21/az-handwritten-alphabets-in-csv-format)

I can't upload the .csv file as it is too large but you can download the file and rename it.

Happy Coding,
Vihan
